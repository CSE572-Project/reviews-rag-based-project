Q: screen quality
BASE: mirror screen for iphone makes it harder to see the screen in the sunlight but it s easier to clean than the original screen or any other screen protector a really bad product it is too small for my sony clie 760c screen the edges are rounded on the screen protector while the clies screen is square leaving an uncovered area about as wide as the tip of the stylus all around the screen while moving the stylus on the corners of the screen it gets stuck on the screen protector film bubbles get under the film really easily while installing and it gives the screen too much glare the screen just looks really bad with the screen protector this screen protector is seriously defective and it is most certainly not compatible with 700 series clies awesome screen ez install i m incredibly happy with this screen it was extremely easy to install it took about 1 5 hours from opening the box to hanging the finished product on the wall you do need 2 people when stretching the screen into place though the screen looks great hanging on the wall very professional looking the big box stores all said that a grey screen would run a minimum of 1000 1200 so i was pretty happy to find one for about half that price i was a little skeptical about the quality prior to purchase but after getting the screen i was very impressed i ve got an epson 8350 paired with this screen and the picture is very impressive the velvet frame finishes the look off very nicely my only complaint and it s not a big one is that on some screen shots a little bit of bleed through shows up on 1 corner of the velvet screen only every now and then all in all i m very happy would definitely recommend this product worst screen ever the screen takes about 20 tries to pull up i think the problem is the screen is thin and the edges curl inward and create a drag also the edge curl causes the picture on the screen to distort not very happy with this purchase sorry nothing nice to say about this screen great value and excellent quality this is the 4th screen and the first one from elite that i have used for home theaters over the past 2 decades the elite ezframe screen 120 is excellent quality and assembly is straight forward the end result is an attactive screen with a very flat surface i e with no waves in the screen material my only negative is elite has a very limited choice in the screen fabrics offered the ezframe series of screens i selected the 1 1 gain matte white it would be great if they also offered a 1 3 or 1 5 gain white fabric in any case the screen works well with my epson 6500ub projector in a fully light controlled home theater ruins the screen do not i repeat do not get this i recieved a nintendo ds for christmas and the protective screen cover ruined the bottom screen gameplay is now blurred and there are bubbles on the screen intec does not belong in the video game industry boycott intec great screen but mechanics are junk purchased this screen to replace an 8 year old elite 120 electric grey screen to make this to the point i installed screen and quickly notice this unit has only a few inches of material between housing and top edge of screen no good if your hiding frame in the ceiling 2nd upon power up the screen malfunctioned and motor would not shut off the dreaded clicks returned to amazon for full refund i suggest others to save their money and buy a favi which has ajustment from stops and both rf and ir remotes palm m505 color screen almost there palm s m505 just can t get started due to the poor color screen in fact for most of my brief encounter i was convinced that the screen was turned off it really is a shame that palm chose such a poor performing screen for their product maybe next year they will have a better screen

Q: comfort and fit
BASE: comfort vs noise these earphones are very comfortable i really love the comfort and color but the noise reduction could use some slight improvements same heartache this book was a lot like the one above came in good time and gave comfort and tears to my daughter great fit and comfort i liked the different colors and loved the fit and comfort more hanes has the best quality ultra comfort and fast delivery i am very pleased with this seat and i would suggest buying this product to anybody trus me you won t regret it these skates are great i purchased these to teach my daughter to roller skate i loved the comfort and they are cute too 0 useful the fans are good and handle some powerful use and give plenty of wind for comfort and the simplicity and bamboo is exatly what i needed comfort the shoe is great i wear then with socks and they fit much better if you want a casual comfort shoe i recommend this one disappointed i recently lost my beloved pet of 15 years and was looking for words of hope and comfort that one day i will get to see him again i did not get that from this book it was brief and i felt like i was reading a children s book i received more comfort and hope from the paragraph i received about the rainbow bridge from the spca i was very disappointed that the book was so short with very little detail normally sylvia describes the afterlife and the ornate buildings and duties and way of life in great detail so my expectations were high i read this book cover to cover in about 5 minutes and came away angry that i wasted my money i realize that afterlife may be a fantasy but in times of mourning you are searching for anything that brings comfort and this book fell extremely short in that area
