Q: screen quality
A: mirror screen for iphone makes it harder to see the screen in the sunlight but it s easier to clean than the original screen or any other screen protector a really bad product it is too small for my sony clie 760c screen the edges are rounded on the screen protector while the clies screen is square leaving an uncovered area about as wide as the tip of the stylus all around the screen while moving the stylus on the corners of the screen it gets stuck on the screen protector film bubbles get under the film really easily while installing and it gives the screen too much glare the screen just looks really bad with the screen protector this screen protector is seriously defective and it is most certainly not compatible with 700 series clies awesome screen ez install i m incredibly happy with this screen it was extremely easy to install it took about 1 5 hours from opening the box to hanging the finished product on the wall you do need 2 people when stretching the screen into place though the screen looks great hanging on the wall very professional looking the big box stores all said that a grey screen would run a minimum of 1000 1200 so i was pretty happy to find one for about half that price i was a little skeptical about the quality prior to purchase but after getting the screen i was very impressed i ve got an epson 8350 paired with this screen and the picture is very impressive the velvet frame finishes the look off very nicely my only complaint and it s not a big one is that on some screen shots a little bit of bleed through shows up on 1 corner of the velvet screen only every now and then all in all i m very happy would definitely recommend this product worst screen ever the screen takes about 20 tries to pull up i think the problem is the screen is thin and the edges curl inward and create a drag also the edge curl causes the picture on the screen to distort not very happy with this purchase sorry nothing nice to say about this screen great value and excellent quality this is the 4th screen and the first one from elite that i have used for home theaters over the past 2 decades the elite ezframe screen 120 is excellent quality and assembly is straight forward the end result is an attactive screen with a very flat surface i e with no waves in the screen material my only negative is elite has a very limited choice in the screen fabrics offered the ezframe series of screens i selected the 1 1 gain matte white it would be great if they also offered a 1 3 or 1 5 gain white fabric in any case the screen works well with my epson 6500ub projector in a fully light controlled home theater ruins the screen do not i repeat do not get this i recieved a nintendo ds for christmas and the protective screen cover ruined the bottom screen gameplay is now blurred and there are bubbles on the screen intec does not belong in the video game industry boycott intec great screen but mechanics are junk purchased this screen to replace an 8 year old elite 120 electric grey screen to make this to the point i installed screen and quickly notice this unit has only a few inches of material between housing and top edge of screen no good if your hiding frame in the ceiling 2nd upon power up the screen malfunctioned and motor would not shut off the dreaded clicks returned to amazon for full refund i suggest others to save their money and buy a favi which has ajustment from stops and both rf and ir remotes palm m505 color screen almost there palm s m505 just can t get started due to the poor color screen in fact for most of my brief encounter i was convinced that the screen was turned off it really is a shame that palm chose such a poor performing screen for their product maybe next year they will have a better screen

Q: camera performance
A: go with the swann bulldog camera this camera has a good picture but easily gets blown out by too much light additionally the stand cannot support the weight of the camera and hood so it constantly needs re adjusted swann makes a nice camera but this one falls short the camera you want is swann bulldog camera we have 3 of those and this one only has slightly better performance in both night and day conditions but the stand holds the camera in place trust me its a big problem on this camera and they are cheaper worst camera ever i bought this camera and with it being 4mp i thought this would be a good starter camera when i opened the box i could not believe the poor quality of this camera it looked like a cheap plastic childs camera that is worth about 10 the flash worked only when it wanted too and the buttons would stick it also paused for about 4 sec between pictures the pictures were blurry so needless to say i sent it back please stay away from this camera very poor camera very pleased i just returned from a european vacation where i used my camera for the first time the camera s performance exceeded my expectations fine for camera only this camera case is absolutely fine if you intend to carry your camera and none of its accessories the camera has a rechargeable battery therefore it has a recharger this case does not have space for the charger this camera has a single cable approximately four feet long used to download pix to computer and or to connect camera to tv the case will not accommodate the camera and the cable if you want to carry your camera and two fingernail clippers no problem this is the case for you if you want to carry your camera charger cable and maybe the instructions to your camera you are out of luck standard operation i bought this camera for my grandson i am very dissapointed in how this camera works when you turn the camera on the flash is automatically off you then have to select the flash on each time the camera is turned on also you can not review the pictures taken in the camera lcd screen you have to upload them to the computer this is suppose to be a point and shot camera i would not buy this camera again great item this is a great lens for the price i actually bought this for my sons camera because i actually own a canon camera i have decided that a nikon is the camera for me after using this lens with my sons camera i dont even want to use my camera anymore i will be purchasing this lens when im able to get me a new camera stay away from camera lcd stopped working camera becomes useless i had this camera for about 5 years now i probably recorded around 4 5 60 minute cassette tapes during this time period and the camera lcd screen stopped working when this happens the camera becomes useless because you cannot view record playback or do anything with the camera the viewfinder is also blank i talked to a sony service representative and it looks like the camera needs to be serviced by a technician now i m going to have to pay money for repairs i m very disappointed with sony on this one great camera i actually bought this camera for my daughter it was a replacement for another camera not kodak that was damaged she absolutely loves it great camera for a great price

A: sound quality is poor i m really disappointed in the tinny sound quality maybe it s a good value if it s mostly used for the alarm but if you re hoping for decent sound quality don t buy this one bad sound quality a huge disappointment extremely poor sound quality from what i thought was a trusted brand name avoid poor sound quality sound quality is poor saving numbers to the phone is also not simple over all improvements are required excellent sound quality the sound quality from these earbuds is truly amazing they do a good job of blocking external noises bad sound quality poor sound quality bad mixing garbled vocals all from a great live band what a shame not recommended poor sound quality the sound quality is way below what i expected for sennheiser little or no bass even after adjusting and changing ear cushions poor sound quality the headset is very comfortable and it comes with two options the over the head one and over the ear the big problem is the sound quality there s something like a buzzing sound when you are on a call the noice stops when you press the mute button if you need good sound quality look for another phone phiilips earbuds sound quality terrible i returned these the day after i received them from amazon they fit ok they were comfortable but the sound quality was absolutely awful
